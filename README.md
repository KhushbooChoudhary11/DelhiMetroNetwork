# Delhi Metro Network Analysis

## Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the Delhi Metro network, covering geospatial, temporal, and structural aspects of the metro system. The goal is to understand various features of the network, including the distribution of metro stations, the expansion of the network over time, and the characteristics of different metro lines and station layouts. Visualizations and analysis are done to identify key insights about the development and structure of the metro system.

## Key Features
#### Geospatial Analysis:

A map is generated to visualize the geographic locations of metro stations, color-coded by the respective metro lines.

The analysis includes interactive features where users can hover over stations to view information about the station name and line.

#### Temporal Analysis:

The project explores the expansion of the metro network over time by analyzing the number of stations opened each year.

A visual timeline is created to show the growth of the metro system, helping to understand periods of rapid expansion.

#### Line Analysis:

Each metro line is analyzed to understand its characteristics, such as the total number of stations and the average distance between them.

A comparative analysis across different lines is performed, highlighting the differences in size and station distribution.

#### Station Layout Analysis:

The distribution of different station layouts (elevated, underground, etc.) is analyzed, providing insight into the structural diversity of the network.

Visual representation of how different layouts are distributed across the stations.

## Dataset
The dataset contains details of all metro stations in the Delhi Metro network, including station names, opening dates, locations (latitude and longitude), distances from the starting point of each line, and station layouts. The data is used to perform geospatial, temporal, and line-based analyses.

## Tools and Libraries
**Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis, especially for handling large datasets, cleaning, and extracting meaningful insights.

**Folium:** Utilized for geospatial analysis to create interactive maps showing metro stations and their locations on the Delhi map.

**Plotly:** A key library for creating interactive visualizations, including bar charts, scatter plots, and subplots, to explore metro station distribution, line analysis, and layout diversity.

## Visualizations
The project heavily relies on interactive visualizations to present findings, including:

**Metro Map:** A detailed map of the Delhi Metro stations with color-coded lines.

**Timeline of Station Openings:** A bar chart showing the number of stations opened each year.

**Line Comparisons:** Bar charts comparing the number of stations per line and the average distance between stations on different lines.

**Station Layout Distribution:** A chart showing the different types of station layouts used in the network.

## Conclusion
The Delhi Metro Network Analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the system's growth, geographical spread, and structural characteristics. The visualizations and data-driven insights help to explore the complexity and development of one of the largest metro systems in the world.
